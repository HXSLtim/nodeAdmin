- [x] PostgreSQL backup/restore automation scripts
- [x] Disaster recovery drill record documented
- [x] CI/CD workflow with M2 gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Phase 5 (Post-M3) Incremental Capabilities

### Backend

- [x] Audit log system — JWT HTTP guard, global interceptor, Drizzle repository, query API (`5aa6e1c` / PR #21)
- [x] Modernizer module — analyze / docSync / controller
- [x] Plugin marketplace Phase 0+1+2 — manifest schema, dynamic NestJS module registration, plugin sandbox, install/uninstall API, version management (`e11a5d9`)
- [x] TenantContext abstraction + `SINGLE_TENANT_MODE` switch (`d132602`)
- [ ] Swagger API documentation (`SwaggerModule.setup()` in `main.ts` + `@ApiTags` across controllers) — spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-29-swagger-modernizer-design.md`, not yet integrated
- [ ] TD-1: upgrade/replace `@nestjs/swagger@11.2.6` to escape exact-pinned `lodash` / `path-to-regexp`

### Frontend

- [x] Audit log timeline UI + filters (`auditLogPanel.tsx`, Timeline primitive)
- [x] Plugin marketplace UI — marketplace page, detail page, installed plugins management, settings page
- [x] Button + Link a11y fixes (`07d0942`, `2cdb769`) — export `buttonVariants`, eliminate invalid `<Button><Link/></Button>` nesting
- [ ] TD-2: resolve `react-intl@10.1.1` vs `@types/react@18.3.28` peer conflict so that `npm install` can regenerate the lockfile from scratch (currently only `npm ci` works)

### Quality and Platform

- [x] CI workflow expanded to 6 jobs: static / unit-test (now also runs `test:adminPortal`) / audit / build / test-integration / docker-build (`b463d59`)
- [x] `.dockerignore` pattern-based allowlist for `apps/adminPortal/` top-level files (`61b1cab` fix + TD-4 hardening)
- [x] CI audit gated by `audit-ci` with documented allowlist (`ad33af1`)
- [x] Audit-ci allowlist 90-day expiry enforced by `scripts/checkAuditAllowlistExpiry.cjs` (TD-5)
- [x] `wait-for-infra` composite action no longer silently continues on port/PG timeout
- [x] Build artifact shared between `build` and `test-integration` jobs via `actions/upload-artifact`
- [x] Frontend unit warnings cleaned up (BacklogPanel duplicate-key, LoginPage `act()`, plugin marketplace Button+Link)
- [ ] TD-3: root-cause Playwright E2E flake (removed from CI in `c33a0fc`) before re-adding E2E job

### Strategic Decisions Pending

- [ ] Agent microservice architecture — see `docs/architecture/agentMicroservicePlan.md` + `agentMicroserviceReview.md`. Potentially conflicts with D-007 (modular monolith through M2); requires project lead to clarify intent before any implementation begins.
